# RESTAURANT-NLP-PROJECT

**PROJECT:** RESTAURANT REVIEWS

**PRIMARY GOAL:** Main goal of the project is to find out whether the feedback which is given by the customer is Positive or Negative.

**SOLUTION:**
1. Data Preprocessing: Data is in textual format (Categorical). Removed the unwanted characters in the sentences except alphabets.
2. Imported/Downloaded stopwords from the nltk. Used the nltk.stopwords to remove the stopwords in the sentences.
3. Extensively used the stemming to get the root form of the word and created BOW (Bag of words) by using the “COUNTVECTORIZER”.
4. Used the various Machine Learning Algorithms to predict whether the feedback is Positive or Negative and Concluded the best model : NAIVE BAYES (The model which is going to solve the problem in a given conditions) and got 75% accuracy.
5. Owned and deployed model by using the “HEROKU”.
